Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

### Who should read this?

Written for graduate students in public health. 

Coding will be question-oriented and set in context – in other words, code solutions will be presented based on how you’ll normally think of questions you’d like to answer. For example: how do get the average age of first pregnancy for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015? 

Information will be posted as I learn them. You’ll be able to see a chronical timeline of how I learned and use it as a guide to inform your own learning plan in a way that feels intuitive. 

### Why should you read this?

I know what it’s like to struggle through the difficult new world of statistics and programming and how to present it in a way that we as public health professionals understand and typically encounter in our work.

Let me know what questions you’d like answered and I’ll do my best to cover that topic. 

No dumb questions!

### Where can I get some?

Like many other public health students, I’ve faced challenges in learning how to code. Official manuals exist, but there’s none that provide an annotated guide of codes that are tailored to public health professionals and health researchers.
