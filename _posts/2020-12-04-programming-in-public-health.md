### Who should read this?

Graduate students in public health and public health professionals who have limited coding experience and would like to learn how to code in Stata for health research. 

### Why should you read this?

I know what it’s like to struggle through the difficult new world of statistics and programming and how to present it in a way that we as public health professionals understand and typically encounter in our work.

### Why did I start this?

I’ve faced challenges in learning how to code. Official manuals exist, but there’s none that provide an annotated guide of codes that are tailored to public health professionals and health researchers.

### What will I be posting about?
Coding solutions will included real-world, public health examples. 
code solutions will be presented based on how you’ll normally think of questions you’d like to answer. For example: 
* How do I get the average age of a woman's first pregnancy for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015? 

Information will be posted as I learn them. You’ll be able to see a chronological timeline of how I learned and use it as a guide to inform your own learning plan in a way that feels intuitive. 

### Feedback and ideas
Let me know what questions you’d like answered and I’ll do my best to cover that topic. 

> No dumb questions!
