### Who should read this?

Graduate students in public health and public health professionals who have limited coding experience and would like to learn how to code for health research. 

_For now, posts will focus on coding in Stata._ 

### Why should you read this? Why am I doing this?

Statistics and programming is fascinating and can be incredibly satisfying to learn - but it can also be challenging. Official coding resources exist, but few software provide an annotated guide tailored for public health professionals and health researchers with limited coding background.

I hope to fill this gap by sharing information in a way that we as public health professionals understand and typically encounter in our work.

### What will I be posting about?
Coding solutions will include real-world, public health and epidemiological examples. By _setting code in context_, I hope to show how the relevance of code to answer questions you are likely to encounter in research and practice. For example: 
> How do I get the average age of a woman's first pregnancy for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015? 

Information will be posted as I learn them. You’ll be able to see a chronological timeline of how I learned Stata coding and use it as a guide to inform your own learning plan in a way that feels intuitive. 

### Feedback and ideas
Let me know what questions you’d like answered and I’ll do my best to cover that topic. No dumb questions!
