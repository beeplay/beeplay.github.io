# Consistency and avoiding errors is key in coding
In some jobs, itâ€™s important to ensure consistency and minimizing the risk of errors. In coding, we'd like to do the same thing, especially when we are doing repetitive tasks.

_To do this in coding, we can use loops._

```stata
forvalues x=1/25
  gen bagel `x'=plain if spread==`x'

```

## Practical takeaways 
> Consider using loops for any tasks you have to repeat 2+
