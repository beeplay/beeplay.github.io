You will likely come across situations where your code will not run.  

These situations can be frusterating, especially when the culprit is often a small comma or syntax that's missing from your code.  

Some ideas for troubleshooting: 
* **Scan your code line by line.** I eventually identified a few missing letters that were the likely culprit of my non-functioning code: 
* **Compare your code to reference code.** If you're using a reference code (ex. from the internet or something your collegue shared with you), compare your code to the reference code and look for any differences. 
* **Narrate the intended action of your code outloud.** Try saying outloud what each line of code is doing. Sometimes vocalizing things can highlight obvious problems that you otherwise overlooked when simply reading your code. H/T to my collegue, Rachel J, for this tip! üôè
* **Take a break.** When all else fails, a walk is sometimes the best solution
