##### The coding process
Coding will generally go like :
1. write code
2. execute code
3. see results

##### Getting used to Stata display
In Stata, you “run” or execute codes in 2 windows: 
*	Window 1 is your “.do” file where you write out code
*	Window 2 is where you see the results of your code  

##### Coding best practices
In all statistical software, there are codes for good practice.
