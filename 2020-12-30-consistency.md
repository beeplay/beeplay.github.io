**Code speak**: How to loop over variables, looping, foreach

# Consistency and avoiding errors is key in coding
In some jobs, itâ€™s important to ensure consistency and minimizing the risk of errors. In coding, we'd like to do the same thing, especially when we are doing repetitive tasks.

_To do this in coding, we can use loops._

```stata
forvalues x=1/25
  gen bagel `x'=plain if marmalade==`x'
```
## Break down 
* forvalues means
* 1/25 means we want to list 1-25 values in increments of 1 
* gen means we want to _generate_ or create a new variable called bagel, that will represent _plain_ (or contain the value plain) **IF** the marmalade variable is equal to ``x'`
* == means "equal to". It's a type of [syntax] (https://www.stata.com/manuals13/psyntax.pdf)

## Practical takeaways 
* Consider using loops for any tasks you have to repeat 2+ 
* Looping helps you achieve consistency and reduce risk of coding errors (not necessarily to save on typing)
